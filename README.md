# Self-Care Center 
### Abstract:
- This website allows users to receive a mantra or affirmation. After selecting the type of message and clicking a button, a random mantra or affirmation message is displayed to the user. Additionally, users can remove a message if they do not like it and that message will not be displayed to the user again. If a user removes all of the messages, they will be alerted to refresh the page in order to receive a message again.

### Installation Instructions:
- git clone this repo to your local machine
- cd into that directory
- git open index.html to open the browser
- Get inspired by affirmations and mantras.

### Context:

### Learning Goals:
- My learning goal was not only to create a landing page identical to the mockup using HTML and CSS, but also to add functionality to the radio inputs and buttons with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I wanted to use and grow my understanding of functions that rely on a user event in the browser. I also wanted to get more practice using git commands, pushing code into the remote repo and pulling it back down to my local machine.

### Wins + Challenges:
- I refactored my HTML to be more semantic while also using div containers for styling.
- In my CSS file, I stored the colors used throughout the website in CSS variables with semantic identifiers so they can easily be referenced or globally updated.
- Although I revisited the Flexbox Froggy game before beginning this project, achieving the desired layout of buttons was challenging. Paying attention to parent/child relationships between HTML elements and reading up on the CSS box model helped my understanding.
- I am continuing to gain familiarity with using MDN Docs as a tool for research and troubleshooting.
